    <h1> Coding </h1>

    <span>Lets place things here that I will be learning and developing</span>

    <article class="">
      <p>My first blog on the Sunday 27th of January 2019. I have no idea what codes I need to used for the making of a correct blog but thats ok. That is why I am doing this to start with. I am just creating to start creating. Setting up my ideas as I go and then sharing them to the world with my very limited knowledge of what I am doing with html and css. </p>
      <p>I have a goal of learning to code so that I can be mobile with my life. I want to travel around adn be able to create as I go. I have no real idea what that will look like with regards to what I will create. I could be for myself or it could be for others.  I would rather for myself, so that means making and developing ideas and also expanding my knowledge of code.</p>
      <p>I am writing this directly into my Atom software. I look forward to this journey.  A new life after a depressive background. This is for a different blog completely.</p>
